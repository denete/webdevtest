Instructions
============

Your Task
---------

Using the provided feed data, construct a page that is formatted to match the included mockups. You will only be using one HTML document for this test. Your document will render both a promotion view and a promotion list view determined by the URL / query string.

The promotion view layout should be responsive and render as shown in the wide mockup (webdevtest/mockup-wide.jpg) for viewports greater than 480 pixels and as shown in the 480px mockup (webdevtest/mockup-480.jpg) below that breakpoint.

Place your HTML in webdevtest/src/index.html. All other resources should be saved where appropriate in the webdevtest/src hierarchy.

Feed Data
---------

Your page should load data from the provided datafile. Almost no content will be hard-coded into your document.

- webdevtest/src/js/webdevtest-data.js

URLs and page rendering
-----------------------

The page should render the promotion list view (webdevtest/mockup-list.jpg) when accessed by the URL below.

webdevtest/src/index.html

The links from the promotion list view should take us to the individual promotion view. The page should render one of the three promotions from the feed data when accessed by the URLs below.

- webdevtest/src/index.html?promo=promo01
- webdevtest/src/index.html?promo=promo02
- webdevtest/src/index.html?promo=promo03
