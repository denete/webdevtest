      Any non-winning $5 ticket is eligible for entry. Each ticket submitted will result in one (1) entry into the drawing. An unlimited number of qualifying tickets can be entered, but each ticket can only be entered once. You do not need to keep original tickets to claim a second-chance prize. However, once Official Entry Codes have been submitted online, please check the regular drawing results before discarding tickets.
